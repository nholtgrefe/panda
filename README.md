This is the repository corresponding to the paper: 
> **PaNDA: Efficient Optimization of Phylogenetic Diversity in Networks**.
> *Niels Holtgrefe, Leo van Iersel, Ruben Meuwese, Yukihiro Murakami, Jannik Schestag.*
> bioRxiv, 2025. doi: [10.1101/2025.11.14.688467](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.14.688467)

## Using PaNDA
The **PaNDA** software is easy to install and can either be run with a graphical user-interface (GUI) for inexperienced programmers, or as part of our Python package `phypanda` which allows for more functionality (and is therefore recommended if the user is experienced with Python). For an installation guide and a more detailed overview of the features (including screenshots for the GUI), please click on the links below to visit the `README.md` files in the respective folders:
- [gui](https://github.com/nholtgrefe/squirrel/tree/main/gui), for the graphical user-interface (Windows and Linux only);
- [physquirrel](https://github.com/nholtgrefe/squirrel/tree/main/physquirrel), for the corresponding Python package.

To test out the GUI or the Python package, we recommend using the Xiphophorus phylogenetic network in the file [`exp2_xiphophorus_network.txt`](https://github.com/nholtgrefe/panda/blob/main/data/exp2_xiphophorus_network.txt).

## Supplementary data and scripts
The simulation results, data sets and used scripts from the experiments in the paper are all in the folder [data](https://github.com/nholtgrefe/panda/tree/main/data). For a more detailed explanation of these files, see the `README.md` file in the folder.
